# CustomerPersonalityAnalysis
Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

As part of my recent project, I analyzed customer segments to uncover insights into purchasing behavior, income distribution, and demographics. Here’s a snapshot of what I found:

## Income Distribution by Education and Marital Status:
Customers with a Graduation-level education generate the highest income, totaling $59M, which is more than double the next highest, PhD holders, at $27M.
Married customers contribute the most, with $44M (38.3% of total income), followed by those who are Together or Single, indicating potential targeting strategies by relationship status.

## Age and Income Trends:
Income by age shows a peak around 48-52 years, with incomes around $4M. However, there's a noticeable decline in income after age 60.
This insight could inform age-targeted campaigns, especially focusing on mid-career professionals.

## Revenue by Purchase Channel:
Total revenue stands at $115.1M, with significant customer engagement through Store Purchases (13K transactions), followed by Web Purchases (9K) and Deals Purchases (5K).
This data emphasizes the importance of in-store experiences, though online channels remain essential.

## Product Category Insights:
Wines are the leading product category, generating $670K in income, while Meat follows with $367K. Other categories like GoldProds and Fish have comparatively lower income levels.
These insights suggest prioritizing wine-related promotions and offerings, potentially catering to the high demand.

Through this analysis, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how customer characteristics relate to income and purchasing habits. These insights provide a foundation for data-driven decision-making in customer targeting and product marketing.
